# ATMASS
Automatic Traffic Management and Surveillance System


Check out our other project on www.street-smart.co.in

This repository is about a project that we did in our 1st year of engineering. The project was selected for an inter-college Project Display competition called the 'Polarizer' held in Mumbai and was awarded a runner up position. Further with some modifications we wrote a research paper which is now published in IEEEXplore.

The steps to execute this project are explained on https://street-smart.co.in/automatic-traffic-management-and-surveillance-system-atmass/ . 

To know more about the various applications of this model check out our research work https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9299578.

Don't forget to cite the paper if you reproduce this work.
